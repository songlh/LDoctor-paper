\subsection{Methodology}

\comment{
Previous work \cite{PerfBug,SongOOPSLA2014} studied the on-line bug
databases of five representative open-source software projects:
(1) Apache suite, including HTTPD web server written in C/C++,
TomCat server written in Java, and Ant build management tool in Java;
(2) Chromium Google Chrome browser in C/C++;
(3) GCC compiler in C/C++;
(4) Mozilla web browser and
Email client in C/C++ and JavaScript; 
(5) MySQL database server in C/C++.
Through a mix of random sampling and 
manual inspection, they 
found 65 performance problems that are perceived and reported by users. 
Among these 65 problems, 45 are related to inefficient loops and 
hence are the target of the study 
here.

Our previous work \cite{PerfBug,SongOOPSLA2014} studied the on-line bug
databases of five representative open-source software projects:
(1) Apache suite, including HTTPD web server written in C/C++,
TomCat server written in Java, and Ant build management tool in Java;
(2) Chromium Google Chrome browser in C/C++;
(3) GCC compiler suite in C/C++;
(4) Mozilla suite, including Firefox web browser and Thunderbird
Email client in C/C++ and JavaScript; 
(5) MySQL database server in C/C++.
By manually inspecting a set of randomly sampled bug reports,
previous work identified 
65 performance problems that are perceived and reported by users~\cite{SongOOPSLA2014}.
Among these 65 problems, 45 problems are related to inefficient loops and 
hence are the target of the study
here.

\footnote{The definition of ``loop-related'' in this paper is a little
bit broader than earlier paper~\cite{SongOOPSLA2014}, which only considers
43 problems as loop-related. }.
More details can be found in previous papers that collected
these bugs.

\textit{Coverage:}
As shown in Table \ref{tab:root}, 
our taxonomy does cover all inefficient loops under study. 
Resultless loops are about as common as redundant loops
(24 vs. 21).
Not surprisingly, 0* loops
are rare in mature software. 
%In fact, no bugs in this
%benchmark suite belong to this category.
All other root-cause sub-categories are well represented.


\textit{Actionability:}
As shown in Table \ref{tab:root}, 
the root-cause categories in our taxonomy are well correlated with
fix strategies.
This indicates that our taxonomy is actionable --- once the root cause
is identified, developers roughly know how to fix.
For example, 
almost all 0*1? resultless loops are fixed by data-structure changes;
all [0$|$1]* resultless loops are
fixed by conditionally skipping the loop;
almost all redundant loops are fixed either by 
memoization or batching. 
The only problem is that there are no silver bullets for fixing 1* loops.
%all inefficient loops with xx root cause are fixed by xxx.
%xxx

\textit{Generality:}
The root-cause categories in our taxonomy are designed to be 
generic. Table \ref{tab:root} also shows that these categories 
each appears in multiple
application in our study. The only exception is $0^*$-resultless, which
never appears. 


In summary, the study above informally demonstrates that our taxonomy
is suitable to guide our design of \Tool.
